# lcd-ili9341

API wrapper for the Ilitek [ILI9341] LCD controller. Requires a trait you
must implement to provide the hardware interface to the LCD. Exposes the API
documented in the ILI9341 datasheet, hiding details of how the commands are
formatted.

This wrapper was created for the [PortaPack] project.
